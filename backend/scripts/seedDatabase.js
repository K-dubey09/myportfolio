Microservices architecture has become the gold standard for building scalable, maintainable applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to build robust microservices using Node.js.

## Why Microservices?

Microservices offer several advantages:
- **Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand
- **Technology Diversity**: Use different technologies for different services
- **Team Independence**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't bring down the entire system

## Getting Started
